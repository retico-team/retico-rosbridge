# Retico_Ros2 Repository

In this repository you can find the interface between ReTiCo and ROS2 (in `retico_ros2`) and some demo scripts (with their documentations) which are located in `demo`.

## Installation Guides
For ReTiCo, please follow the steps  [here](https://github.com/retico-team/retico-core/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted.md)(currently pip install doesn't work, but you can use the `setup.py` in [the repository](https://github.com/retico-team/retico-core)). 
To install ROS2 Foxy, you may follow [the official guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) or [this (with docker on Linux/MacOS)](https://github.com/opallch/ur3e_environment/wiki/Installation-Guide).

## Getting Started
If you are new to ReTiCo, [this documentation](https://github.com/retico-team/retico-core/blob/main/docs/basics.md) is very useful. For ROS2, you may take a look at the [official tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html).
